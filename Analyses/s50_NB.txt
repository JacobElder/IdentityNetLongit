Good convergence is indicated by the t-ratios of non-fixed parameters being close to zero.

Overall maximum convergence ratio =  NA .
*** Warning: Covariance matrix not positive definite *** 
***            Standard errors not reliable           *** 
The approximate linear combination that has variance 0 is
1 * beta[4] + -1 * beta[5] + 1 * beta[6] + 1 * beta[7]
(This may be unimportant, and related to the fact
 that some parameters are fixed.)

Covariance matrices
                   
There is a linear dependency between the parameter estimates
 therefore the covariance matrix should not be used.
